                    <h3 class="subtitle">“To symbolize the complete severance from his previous life, he even adopted a new name. No longer would he answer to Chris McCandless; he was now Alexander Supertramp, master of his own destiny. Why do you think that Chris changed his name? What do you think it means to assume a new identity in this context?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your name is such a distinctive feature of your identity. A name can tell you a lot about the person you are, your family, your background, etc. For instance, my name is Maria Jose but most people wouldn&#39t guess that from MJ. Although I go by a nickname, why did I change it? When I first came to the US, people kept messing up my name and it really, really annoyed me. People called me Maria Gomez, Jose Saavedra, or any other kind of combination of my names; but that wasn&#39t my name. I solved it by shortening my first name and hyphenating my last names. I would expect Chris went through a similar thought process. He was tired of his old identity and decided to adopt a new one, and the easiest way to do so is by scraping his old name. I also think this had to do with his not wanting to be found by his family, and his past life as he embarked on a new one.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Do you consider this type of story an informational piece? or a tragedy we should feel bad about? A cautionary tale?</h3>
                    <p>I think Chris&#39 story is a little bit of all: a tragedy, informational and cautionary. My favorite kind of movie is that which conveys a lesson, something we ought to learn but may be not necessarily black or white. Chris&#39 story does just that. Chris follows his heart in the form of adventure (inspirational); yet, along the way he sacrifices his relationships to pursue self-discovery (tragic). I personally feel bad about Chris, but then again family is everything for me—so I would never be able to do what he did. I do, however, admire his spirit of adventure. </p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">The writer of the book noted that risk taking is a rite of passage. Do you agree? Why or why not?</h3>
                    <p>Risk taking is most definitely a rite of passage. Every action has a reaction, whether you take that to mean positively or negatively. What I mean is that we will always have to make decisions (despite they being big or small) and those decisions have led us to where we are today. My sophomore year of high school I decided to take Chemistry, little did I know I was horrible at Chem; that decision however changed the course of my life. My Chem professor (who was also the dean of academics at my school) called me into his office and said “MJ, I&#39m talking to you as your dean, not your professor. You should drop Chem”—I was shocked. But then he continued “You&#39re good at math, you&#39re highly logical… have you ever considered computer science” and that led me to pursuing a degree in CS. Every action has a reaction. Taking risks and being vulnerable to the great unknown allows us to fail, and failing is the most integral part of success.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Many find it hard to have sympathy for Chris McCandless. His stubborn idealism and lack of preparedness, some have pointed out amounted to arrogance. Yet to others he is seen as a hero. With respect for a lost young life, where do you stand on this issue and why?</h3>
                    <p>Chris&#39 sense of adventure is honestly very admirable. I for one am not really that adventurous nor do I feel the need to be. It is a little bit difficult for me to relate to what he was feeling that drove him to live out such a risk-intensive life. Nonetheless, I do sympathize with him and his story. His suborn idealism was his curse but it also allowed him to do all the wild things he did—and at the end of the day, he passed away doing what he loved. I think some people can easily be drawn to the Transcendentalist writings of David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy convincing them to get back into the wild, and the world we live in truly celebrates people who abandon a certain kind of lifestyle to live out their dreams. This, to me, is admirable and maybe hits a little too close to home. A couple of weeks ago, one of my best friends passed away in a similar manner. My friend was a professional long board skater and in recent years had dropped out of college to pursue his passion: adventure. He had found a lot of success doing what he did and became an “adventure influencer” by jumping out of planes, skateboarding, and hiking. Two weeks ago, while filming a YouTube video for his channel in Ireland, tragedy struck. I have found a lot of peace in the fact that he passed away doing what he loved and that he lived a good story—I can only imagine the same for Chris. </p>
