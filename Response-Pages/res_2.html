                    <p>Times are most definitely different—especially depending of where in the world you are. Flâneur by definition is a French noun referring to a person, literally meaning "stroller", "lounger", "saunterer", or "loafer”. The United States is generally more fast paced than countries in Europe for instance. Take New York for instance, you will never see a New Yorker simply strolling the streets and observing—becoming one with the city; New Yorkers always have some place to be and something to do, and the act of just being does not resonate with them. The act of being a flâneur is entirely European and hence way more common to see them in Europe. I had the privilege to intern in Paris this past summer, and during my time there I encountered many flaneurs—people just going on walks, admiring their city, their culture and sitting down at coffeeshops. 
                    <br><br>
                    Parisian flaneurs, in my opinion, have become café regulars since then. Coffee culture is at the essence of Paris. Unlike Starbucks in the US most just get a coffee to go, a Parisian café is designed to embrace culture and has been the home of artists, writers, intellectuals such as Hemmingway, Picasso, and Manet. This was a long time ago, but frequenting these coffeeshops over the summer and thinking back on this now, the flâneur culture is still very much alive: people sketching, observing, writing and just flanneur-ing.
