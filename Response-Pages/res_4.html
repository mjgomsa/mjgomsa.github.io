                    <h3 class="subtitle">Strayed chose her own last name: “Nothing fit until one day when the word strayed came into my mind. Immediately, I looked it up in the dictionary and knew it was mine; to wander from the proper path, to deviate from the direct course, to be lost, to become wild, to be without a mother or father, to be without a home, to move about aimlessly in search of something, to diverge or digress”. How does this relate to Elkin&#39s characterization of the Flaneuse? Did Cheryl Strayed choose well and why? Do you think that she embodied this new identity? and why did she need to?</h3>
                    <p>I think Strayed&#39s last name relates well to Elkin&#39s characterization of Flaneuse. While Flaneuse and Flaneur are usually related to an individuals&#39 meandering in a city or a town, I think the definition is far more than that. Although Strayed doesn&#39t wander in cities, she does wander in nature and admires the beauty while finding meaning to life in that beauty. I think she picked a great last name, as Shakespeare says “'A rose by any other name would smell as sweet', Cheryl Strayed didn&#39t believe her last name was representative of who she was, so she picked onne that was fitting to her life. Strayed embodies this name perfectly, in a difficult moment of her life, she finds beauty in a traditionally deprecating word such as strayed and that is precisely why the concept of Flaneuse is so well embodied by her.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">Fear is a major theme in this story. Alone on the trail, Strayed encounters dangerous wildlife, the mistakes of her novice preparation and interactions with mostly men in secluded spaces. How do you see the issue of fear, vulnerability and perseverance in this context? How does the sensation of being lost help Strayed find her way back into the world beyond the outdoors? What role does gender play when removed from the usual structure of society and in these open public spaces?</h3>
                    <p>In a time when she was afraid of a lot of things, taking on a bigger fear (of the outdoors) can be therapeutic and help put things into perspective. I think that Strayed&#39s inner resilience came from those fearful experiences she encountered outdoors, fearing for her life allowed her to appreciate her life. Most of Strayed&#39s interactions are with men—and she was forced to interact with them because she wasn&#39t prepared for her hike at all, leading her to have to buy the right gadgets to cook her food and have a meal in a stranger&#39s home. Her ability to accept someone&#39s help despite being afraid at first allowed her to overcome those fears in order to survive. Strayed, as her name suggests, lost her way but it was her being lost that allowed her to find harmony in her life.</p>
