                    <h3 class="subtitle">Drawing on what they considered to be the most useful aspects of these movements (DADA, Surrealism, SI), what do you recognize as the language, practice and/or aesthetic expression of the London Perambulator? And why?</h3>
                    <p>Papadimitriou&#39s exploration exhibits, in my opinion, mostly the concepts of Dada and Situationism. Recalling that Dadaists called these locations “banal places”, while surrealists argued that they were simply insensible—Papadimitriou&#39s argument is mostly focused on realism—hence his ideology can be mostly characterized as a “situation” or that of situationism. To expand on the previous point, situationists orbit the concept of derive, or the search of the extraordinary which is precisely what Papadimitriou does—obtain something unusual from something usual, like London&#39s manholes and sewers. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3 class="subtitle">The nature writer Robert Macfarlane called them “edgelands”, the philosopher Sigmund Freud called them “unconscious” parts of the city. How would you characterize the “overlooked” spaces of the landscape— the liminal yet interactive zones between man and nature in our societies? Ponder about these based on Papadimitriou&#39s observations of them and create your own definition of them, complete with examples.</h3>
                    <p>As trivial as it may sound, overlooked spaces are overlooked only if someone, in fact, overlooks them. Papadimitriou argues that essentially any place can become significant if someone is able to admire its significance. Papadimitriou argues that a place can become forgotten or overlooked—such as the empty lot—when people don&#39t have any significance associated to it. Arguing that these edgelands are not dynamic, he says that these points are often overlooked by the fast-paced lifestyle of our current society. These edgelands, according to Papadimitriou are seemingly stalled in time and are simply overlooked by people who just go on with their day-to-day lives. A good example of this is any parking deck or parking lot or even just sidewalks—people enjoy these common things every day for their practical needs, yet they&#39re often overlooked.</p>
