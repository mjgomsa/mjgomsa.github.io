                    <h4>April 6, 2022</h4>

                    <p>I had a hard time picking a single artist to do this Walkshop on. Initially, I thought I wanted to do an homage to Kubra Khademi&#39s performance to highlight sexual harassment—but I genuinely had no idea how I would be able to make an armor to walk around Chapel Hill in—although I still want to do this in the future, I opted to recreate another artist&#39s work.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I decided to pay homage to Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller&#39s “After Bahuhof”. The piece plays a lot with composition of videos, integrating the past into the present—a theme that I have explored a lot in my last few walk analyses.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>In order to carry out this piece I first researched videos online posted by other users of “walking tours around chapel hill” and such; and my initial idea was to just carry out those same tours but on my own now. Yet, I decided to make this project a little more personal.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I went onto my camera roll and looked through my videos of college, not really knowing what I would find. I was pleasantly surprised to see so many videos of my friends doing silly things in different locations on campus, and decided to recreate Cardiff and Miller&#39s work with those. With my upcoming graduation, I&#39ve started thinking a lot of my friends and the people who have made Chapel Hill feel like a home—and so I wanted my project recreation to focus on the people rather than the place. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shooting these new videos, while playing the videos of my friends from a while back made my heart ache a little. There was an aspect of loneliness and nostalgia in the creation of this project that I didn&#39t anticipate. Revisiting places and memories I have with the people I love the most, made me feel a little melancholic yet this project just really opened my heart to the integration of the past and the present. The following is my result. </p>
