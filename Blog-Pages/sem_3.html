                    <p>This walk shop is inspired by Matthew Reason and John Careri. 
                        <br><br>
                        Careri inspires people to free their nomadic and sedentary spaces despite living in urban geographies. It is because of his approach that I decided to begin my walk on the heart of campus: the old well and headed towards the Croker Arboretum. It is so interesting to me that this was a walking seminar given that I am currently taking Geology and have been learning how to identify rocks, their approximate ages and where they come from. The rocks I encountered in my walk tell a story, and if we observe carefully we can listen to it.

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Climb a Stone</h3>
                    <p>While walking towards the arboretum, I heart this activity and decided to step onto this rock wall that separates the brick path and the lawn.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Perceive a City</h3>
                    <p>While walking around campus, I noticed these rocks piled on top of each other at the edge of a building. The building was sturdy and seemingly made of concrete (another life-form of rocks) and I was intrigued by the landscaping choice of having a bed of rocks at the edge of the building. Embellishing the building this way felt as though if a baker were adorning a cake with cupcakes. </p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Navigate a Forest</h3>
                    <p>By definition, a forest is “a large area covered chiefly with trees”; although the quad at UNC is not necessarily a forest, it is largely covered by trees. Between these trees, lay many brick-made trails that lead busy students to their classrooms. These paths are a web that connect all of campus. </p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Populate Sensations</h3>
                    <p>Holding these little rocks took by back to the quiz I had last week in Geology. I tried to identify the rocks judging them for their light-grey color, their chalkiness and the ability to scratch them. By these properties, I would guess that this type of rock has a lot of calcite in it and is probably some sort of sedimentary rock.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Host a Desert</h3>
                    <p>These bricks caught my attention because unlike most of the paths on campus, had a cooler undertone—probably made using a different material. The cooler tones reminded me of a tundra—lonely, cold and uninviting. </p>
                    <img src="/images/img_sem3/desert.jpg">

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Trace Symbolic Value</h3>
                    <p>I sat down by a bench in the arboretum and right in front of me was a rock wall. I started observing the wall and trying to make out shapes—similar to when you lay and watch clouds in the sky and attempt to point out what they look like.</p>
                    <img src="/images/img_sem3/trace.png">

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Discover a Path</h3>
                    <p>I wasn&#39t sure what this activity was exactly about, I had been walking in paths for a while so I decided to look for paths for non-humans. This rock wall serves as the “path” of where the landscaping is allowed to grow. It not contains the landscape but it guides it in the direction that the gardeners want it to. </p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Interact with an Enclosure</h3>
                    <p>I kept walking and I came across this manhole which was again adorned with a bunch of rocks. I pictured the perfect circle of the manhole top and immediately thought about a riddle my mom used to ask me as a kid. Do you know why manhole lids are a circle? It&#39s because the circle is the only shape that would prevent the manhole lid to fall into the sewers. I looked at the rocks and decided to disrupt their peace by placing one perfectly enclosed in the circle created by the manhole. </p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">To Listen to a Hole</h3>
                    <p>There are so many rock walls on campus, and they probably were made many years ago, hence the walls are perfectly imperfect. There are many holes between the rocks. While I approached the wall, I heard total silence and was shocked to think about the many stories that these rocks have listened to on campus. </p>
