                    <p>I got admitted to UNC in 2018 yet I didn’t really tour the campus until my first week of classes. That first tour was something I will never forget—while I see many of the same landmarks every day, they cannot compare to the first time I saw them. Now as I senior I want to reflect on what it was like to see UNC through the eyes of a freshman. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">The Walk/Tour:</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>I started my walk at the corner of the Inn, given that it is the first sign of University of North Carolina that I see, and tried to forget my way around the campus. I had never noticed that at that corner there is a map to the University and so I studied the map and tried to make my way to the Old Well, trying to forget my past knowledge. </p>

                    <p>On my way to the old well I came across the zig-zags that hold bikes—maybe it is because I’ve never ridden a bike on campus, but I had never noticed them before. I snapped a picture and saw a student place his bike on the zig-zag and lock it. I kept walking and decided to inspect the light poles closely—I had never seen the flower engravings on the middle of them and though that was cool.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>My first time touring the campus I remember grabbing a copy of the Daily Tarheel so I decided it would be very fitting to grab one now and so I did. I kept walking until I reached the meantime coffeeshop area and noticed something new—a new sculpture. I grabbed a seat on one of the benches and decided to look at the turtle for a little bit before continuing with my tour. </p>

                    <p>I decided to head to the main quad—and wow. I’m not sure if it is because it’s spring or just that I’m looking at it with a new, nostalgic set of eyes, but Wilson library looked especially nice in the background. I walked towards it and decided to sit for a while on the quad…until I had a horrible sneezing attack due to my allergies so decided to head to the student stores.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I walked into the student store and headed to the pharmacy upstairs where I picked up some Benadryl for my allergies (a souvenir!) and then asked myself—“if this were my first time visiting campus, what would I get?”. I still don’t own any Carolina gear, so decided to treat myself to a sweatshirt. I headed outside and sat on the pit for a little while longer… taking it all in.</p>
