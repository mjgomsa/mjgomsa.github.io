                    <p>This walk shop instructs us to walk  around a busy city or town-center. Involving the long talks we&#39ve had about flanneur and the response I made on Walk the Line, I decided to give this flanneuring a go. To be a flanneur means to be an observer— being invisible while being visible— a wallflower.

                    <ul>
                        <li>A lot of people walking to and from class (wearing backpacks)</li>
                        <li>People holding umbrellas in case of that 20% rain</li>
                        <li>A lot of people wearing sunglasses</li>
                        <li> A guy, probably in his twenties jogging while listening to music. He speeds up as he passes past me (the song he was listening to probably had a beat drop)</li>

                        <li>I walk past Epilogue, and decide to stop in for a little bit. I record the sounds of the coffeeshop—people talking, the barista banging mugs and the espresso machine. To the corner, I see a guy working on a paper on his laptop— midterms are coming up and he&#39s probably getting ahead on work</li>

                        <li>A couple walks in front of me, holding hands— they seem very much in love. Probably the first few weeks of their relationship. Or maybe just still very much in love. </li>
                        <li>A mom and two little kids, getting a couple of sodas from Suttons. I smile at them and they smile back. I stick my tongue out to him in a jokingly manner and he copies and giggles shyly.</li>
                        <li>I keep walking and realize most people are walking closer to the display windows than to the road— why is that? Maybe to watch out for reckless drivers I think. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    

                    <p>
                    I decided to stop at Linda&#39s and get a late-afternoon coffee while sitting outside. An old man, sitting across from me smiles and asks me how&#39s my day going— “ very well, you?” I reply. “very well” he says politely. I decide to get out my sketchbook and discretely begin sketching out the man, yet not even 3 minutes later he gets up and leaves. I&#39d like to think he had to get home in time for dinner to his wife, and that his cute little grandkids were going to visit. <br><br></p>

                    <p>I sipped my coffee, listened to the audio and kept hanging at Linda&#39s for a bit. I ordered my check and decided to head home. Very successful day as a flanneur overall</p>
