                    <p>Being rooted despite the everchanging landscape of the world we live in can be challenging at times. To find the spiritual north in our lives can be a perplexing concept—yet our “sixth sense” allows us to echolocate (similar to bats or dolphins) through sound. Yet, on most of use that sixth sense can be dormant.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I decided to conduct this walk in a place further away from my other walks: Duke Gardens. Duke Gardens is a very well-signed place so from the beginning of my walk, I decided to ignore all signage to try and orient myself based on my sixth sense and nothing more. My first step was to head into the cross-section of various paths—and opened my compass app on my phone. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This was around 6:30pm and the sun was beginning to set in the horizon, so I knew I was facing to the West. I decided to close my eyes and feel the light rays of the sun on my skin. I tried focusing on the smell and I obtained musky scents from the trees ahead of me and some sort of flower—I think they were lilies. What are my intentions? I don&#39t really know… I&#39m here, in these partially man-made gardens appreciating beauty. I say they&#39re partially man-made because, while the gardens are very well taken care of, and have labels for all the different kinds of species, some of the trees here are very old (indicating that most likely before this was a garden it was a forest).</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I reorient myself. Take a few steps to what I believe is the North and arrive at a fountain. I smell many different flowers and I hear the croaking of a frog amongst the little fish on the fountain. I feel at ease.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I close my eyes and try to picture myself in Chapel Hill, outside of my building—while still facing the west (I would be standing with my apartment building to my left). To my North I can the sign for Target, to my South I see Granville Towers and the little dog park with the big Orange statue, and to my East I see the parking deck.</p>

                    <p>It&#39s funny because I&#39ve never considered myself a very oriented person—I have always had a hard time guiding people to places they&#39ve never been. But now, thinking about the surrounding spaces, the surrounding gardens, I realize I am not so disoriented as I thought. </p>
