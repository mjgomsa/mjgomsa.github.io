                    <p>The Covid-19 Pandemic has globally changed the way we live out our lives. Recalling a world where we didn&#39t have to wear masks or constantly worry about the surfaces we touch is bizarre to me—despite the mask mandate being lifted. Prior to my walk, I began recalling what the start of the Pandemic was for me—I obviously didn&#39t own a mask prior to March 2020. Yet, wearing a mask became the new normal for over two years and now I can&#39t imagine not wearing one in public, closed spaces. I understand that we must trust the CDC regulations, but in my personal opinion, it is vastly too soon to have lifted the mask mandate; and I for one, have and will continue wearing my mask in crowded spaces.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I decided to start my walk on Franklin St—I don&#39t wear my mask while I&#39m walking outside but I do carry one on my wrist in case I do end up walking into an establishment. It&#39s interesting how in my day-to-day walks to class or elsewhere I can utterly forget that we&#39re still in the midst of a Pandemic. I began noticing if people are wearing masks outside; yet, not a lot of people can be seen wearing a mask, nor having one on them. I decide to run a social experiment and sit on a bench, and begin tallying up the people I do see wearing a mask or at least have one on their wrists. One…. Two…. That&#39s it, two people in the span of ten minutes were seen wearing masks, and neither of them seemed like students.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I often think about the ramifications that the pandemic has had on Chapel Hill residents. When the Pandemic first hit, I remember reading in the Daily Tarheel about many kids in Greek life hosting massive &#39spreader&#39 parties, and all I could think about were those poor Chapel Hill residents. People who live here year-round, and are constantly being exposed by the carelessness of college students.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I walk past the store fronts and notice remnants of the mask mandate; signs outside of windows, remnants of stickers on the ground marking the social distance, and a lot of masks on the sidewalks. The pandemic has not only changed the way we view each other—as a possible disease carrier—but also how we approach establishments as a whole. Local businesses were very harmed during the pandemic, with some of them never recovering (Franklin St still has many, many vacancies). It seems to me as though those empty stores are a reminder that the pandemic isn&#39t over just yet, and we still have a long way to go. </p>
