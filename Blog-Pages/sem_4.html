                    <p>Careri defines wandering as walking without an outlined destination—hence I started my walk towards the Forest Theater and kept on walking without any destination in mind. I decided to put my phone on do not disturb and used only when absolutely necessary to take pictures and what not—but even that, I tried to be very selective about the pictures I wanted to take and decided to do the majority of my work through sketches on my iPad. 
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to look up the wandering society only to find a key of symbols to look for in my walk, or at least to think of while walking:

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Summoning Fellow Wanderers</h3>
                    <p>I thought about how to deal with sketching and walking and decided to just sit on the ground whenever I saw something that caught my eye, or whenever I was really interested in the conversation at hand. Professor Marzan began the discussion of how he came about the Wandering Society—in a bookshop followed by a myriad of Walt Whitman references. “Walt Whitman will show you the way”. I can&#39t say I remember much about Whitman&#39s “Leaves of Grass”, except for how it made me feel: happy. It&#39s no secret that Whitman was talented, insightful and had a great understanding of what it meant to be alive. He convinced his readers to reassess everything and think about their own existence.

                        So, how do we summon these great spirits?
                        <br>
                        1.	Collect and gather
                        <br>
                        2.	Remain open on what to discover
                        <br>
                        3.	Allow ideas
                        <br>
                        4.	Question everything
                        <br>
                        5.	Use you imagination
                        <br>
                        6.	Follow hunches
                        <br>
                        7.	Examine nature
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Trees are the spirit between sky and earth. A couple of years ago, I read Peter Wohlleben&#39s book “The Hidden Lives of Trees,” an enlightening account of the forest, and the science that shows us how trees communicate, feel, and live. Wohleben shares his deep love of trees and outdoors as he explains the lives of trees: their births, deaths, and regeneration—proving just how truly alive trees are.

                    <p>I ended my walk by sitting there for about ten minutes in absolute silence, reflecting and being grateful. Lastly, I grabbed a nearby twig and left the second symbol of my key in the ground. </p>
