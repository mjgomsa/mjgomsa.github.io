                    <p>We&#39re told to think straight, walk straight and sit up straight. But why don&#39t we consider circular motion good? Our entire lives are lived out in a linear manner often dictated by society. When we are of appropriate age, we are enrolled in pre-school, followed middle-school, followed by high-school, college, jobs, etc. It&#39s almost as though this procedural line has been drawn out for us since birth. With my impending graduation, I decided to disrupt the linearity of this path that I have been on since I was very young.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For many years now, I have been listening to Louise Hay&#39s self-help audios on YouTube and they&#39ve helped a lot. My favorite one is called “Overcoming fears,” a meditative account that allows you to move past the anxieties that one may have on their day-to-day. Louise Hay&#39s audios and this audio specifically has allowed me to relieve my emotions when I can&#39t even start to explain them. Every day when I wake up, I set this 20min audio and listen to it while I&#39m still half asleep. Louise Hay explains that you don&#39t have to be fully awake to meditate, and that playing this in the back of your mind will have long-lasting effects on your life. So I listen to this audio—half awake—and usually by the time my alarm goes off I&#39m ready to start my day.</p>

                    <p>I decided to conduct my Circumambulation within my room, around the cap I will be inevitably wearing a few weeks from now. This morning I slept in, since its Saturday—and so I didn&#39t get a chance to play my “Overcoming fears” video. I decided this Walkshop would be the perfect instance to listen to it. This cap is representative of my 17+ years of education. I am deeply thankful to my family and God for having given me the opportunity to go to such great schools and to allow me to live out my dreams. Yet, with the conclusion of this chapter of my life comes a lot of fear of what&#39s next? The chronology of the linearity of my education is reaching an end, and that scares me. It scares me to know that in a short while I will no longer be a college student; yet, at the same time it excites me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It&#39s a weird feeling what I have been feeling. I am generally not to well-spoken when it comes to transmitting my emotions, so I hoped that through this circumambulation I would be able to internalize and visually express some of those fears and thrills that I&#39ve been overwhelmed by in the last few days. The following is my result. </p>
