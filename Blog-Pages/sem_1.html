                    <p> 
                        When Professor Marzan first showed us Douglas Paulson and Christopher Robbins&#39 video I was intrigued; up until this point of my life I had never considered non-physical actions or experiences art. To me, interpretative art wasn&#39t exactly art. Paulson and Robbins, aware of their own whereabouts, planned to meet in the middle of their geographical locations; with ruler in hand, they mapped the latitude and longitude and decided to meet at that location on a specific date and time. After that original arrangement, they cut all communications with each other and relied that the other would show up to the location at the designated time. Their art was their respective journeys to meet each other—reinforcing what we have learned all semester: walking is art.

                    <p>
                        I wanted to do my own rendition of this meditative art. My classmate Madeleine and I decided to mimic Paulson and Robbins artwork in our own way; yet, since we&#39re both currently in Chapel Hill our trek wouldn&#39t be that interesting. We decided to modify our original locations to be our birthplaces. I was born in San José, Costa Rica and Madeleine&#39s hometown is ———; hence, our middle point was somewhere near the coast of Cuba, but we decided to shift it a bit to be Santa Clara Cuba.

                        Despite being Latin American, I am embarrassed to admit I don&#39t know much about Cuba&#39s history (except for the Cuban Missile Crisis and a little about Cuba&#39s Revolutionary War). I was shocked to learn the politically rich history behind Santa Clara and even more so to see the expression of this history in the form of art. The entire city is covered in murals depicting their history: murals of Che Guevara, murals of the battles and murals crying for peace. I looked up Santa Clara&#39s history and learned that the battle that ended the Revolutionary War occurred here. Santa Clara is covered by 636 miles of train tracks and during the times of the Revolutionary War they were the main source of transportation. These train tracks also resulted in the victory of the revolutionary rebels led by Che Guevara (we&#39ll go into this further in our project). 
                        <br><br>
                        Madeleine and I decided to focus on the historic train tracks and wondered what it would be like to travel through them. We started at the main train station in Santa Clara, “boarded a train” and started our journey. Using Google Maps and photos by local tourists we imagined what traveling by train would&#39ve looked like in the late 1950s and compared them to what we were seeing. The views were mostly through very humble towns, foliated with a lot of trees and dirt roads. I imagined what I would be doing on that train ride—and the answer was sketching the landscapes. Using my iPad and reference photos from Google Maps, I sketched out the station and the view from the train&#39s conductor cart. 
                        <br><br>
                        The following is our resulting project: <span style="font-weight:bold;">“Train of Thought—Santa Clara”</span>
