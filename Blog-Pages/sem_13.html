                    <p>Chapel Hill as a whole has been the place I&#39ve lived for the last four years—but to be fully candid, it didn&#39t feel homey until this last year. For three years, I lived here and went to school here but I had no real connection to any of the places I spent time in. For a while I was in a sorority and to say I never felt comfortable in it would be an understatement. I dropped my sorority and started hanging out with friends that were more similar to me, and once I found my people Chapel Hill began feeling as a home. It wasn&#39t until this group of people that I began feeling comfortable and familiar in places that felt foreign in the past. I decided to map out some of these places prior to my walk.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Somewhere unfamiliar:</h4>
                    <p>For having living in the same area of Chapel Hill for two years I can honestly say there are plenty of places I don&#39t know. I stepped outside my building and walked on Franklin St—the first thing I realized when turning right on the corner with Target was that there was a cute little UNC gear shop. I have probably walked in front of this store a million times, yet I have never gone in. I decided to go in and walk around the store for a little bit. Saw some really cool gear so decided to get my mom a UNC sweater. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Somewhere that reminds me of Home:</h4>
                    <p>I stepped out of the first shop and tried to think of something that would remind me of home—and I struggled with this. What makes a place a home? People, family, food, dogs? Costa Rica and Chapel Hill are vastly different, and in my four years I haven&#39t come into contact with something that makes me go, “wow this reminds me of Costa Rica”. I guess the closest thing to it, would be the Mexican mini-mart, “Tienda Hispana” on West Rosemery Street. So I walked towards there, walked in a purchased a couple of canned “Ducal frijoles molidos”—my favorite refried beans. I&#39m not sure what I could do to remind me of home but, I think cooking these beans in the way my mom does is going to hit pretty close to home. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Another Somewhere unfamiliar:</h4>
                    <p>I kept walking and took a right on the corner where TOPO is. And at that point I saw the Church that sits on that street corner. Similar to the UNC gear shop, I have probably walked here a thousand times without ever stopping to go in there. I stopped there and sat at the steps of the church. I couldn&#39t think of any objects that would make this place seem more familiar, given that I have never been here before. But I looked to my left and saw the corner of TOPO, which reminded me of a familiar experience—when we won the Duke game and everyone was gathered in this corner. I smiled. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Somewhere familiar:</h4>
                    <p>I kept walking and in front of me I saw the Carolina Inn—and immediately was surrounded by the many, many memories I have had there. This place comforts me like no other, the lively music year-round, their hot chocolate in the winter, their tree that is no longer there. I think this place feels familiar for all the memories I have had here, and I know I&#39ve mentioned it in the past, but I see no harm in revisiting the familiar. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Somewhere fascinating:</h4>
                    <p>I took a left on the Inn and headed to campus and realized something I hadn&#39t noticed to this point. I always take the same route to my classes on campus, and because this semester I have most of my classes at Hanes, it&#39s been a while since I walked to campus. I hadn&#39t notice that the building under construction by Memorial Hall was finished. That fascinated me, and surprised me. Apparently, this new building is part of the MEJO school and the first floor is all glass windows. I cupped my hands and pressed my face to the glass and was drawn to the cool images on the TV wall. </p>

                    <h4 style="color:white;">Somewhere Special:</h4>
                    <p>I walked onto the quad and immediately was drawn to our tree—the second tree on the right, closest to Wilson Library. That tree has been me and my friend&#39s meeting spot for over two years and I love it with my whole heart. Most days someone in our friend group would text the acronym “MAQ”, standing for “Meet at quad” and it would be our signal to go sit down at the quad for a little bit. I marked our spot.</p>
