                   <p>All throughout class we explored El Camino de Santiago Compostela—and all through class what I kept thinking was about the half a dozen times my mom has made that trek. My entire family on my mom&#39s side is from Spain—her mom&#39s side is from Barcelona and her dad&#39s from Galicia (not too far from el Camino). Coming from a traditionally Catholic family, ever since I was young there has always been a saint or a patron my mom would advise me to pray to when I encountered hardships—“San Antonio” for lost things, “San Juan” for the sick, etc. </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>The first time she travelled el Camino de Santiago was when she was trying to get pregnant with me. After the two successful pregnancies of my brothers, something was wrong that she could no longer get pregnant. After five years of trying she decided to try IVO, only to fail again. Every day she would pray to God for a miracle, and my grandmother recommended to do El Camino de Santiago. She booked a plane ticket, and embarked on the trek.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Pilgrimages such as this one, are often done with a greater reason in mind—the health of a loved one, a request for a miracle, gratitude, etc. When looking at the reasons as to why I might embark on a pilgrimage too many stand out to me—with my impending graduation, I have so much to be thankful for while at the same time having a lot of fear of the future.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>There is so much uncertainty in my life right now it&#39s kind of hard for me to focus on the tasks at hand. For the first time in my life, I have absolutely no idea where I will be in six months, let alone two months. When we were in first grade, we knew the next step was second grade. When we finished middle school, we knew the next step was high school. When graduating high school, we knew college was on the horizon; but, when we graduate college…. What&#39s next? This is the first time in my life I actually feel like I have a blank canvas, and the taunting blankness of it is terrifying me. I&#39m about to graduate with a degree from Computer Science from one of the best universities in the country; yet, the kind of jobs that are available for my degree don&#39t really appeal to me. I applied for an MFA program at Parsons, something I am really, truly excited for—but the uncertainty of waiting for an admissions decision is killing me. I was to dedicate this pilgrimage to my mother—who not only persistently fought to have me, but has also always been beyond generous with all my endeavors. In addition to my gratitude, I am also dedicating this pilgrimage to the Parsons admission committee—hoping their deliberations will turn to my favor.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>As I see it, there&#39s two sides to this pilgrimage: gratitude to my mom, and finding peace in the uncertainty of admission decisions. My mom&#39s in Costa Rica at the moment, but whenever she comes to visit she stays at the Carolina Inn, hence the first part of my pilgrimage will be towards there. I embark on my walk taking a right from my apartment building, I cross the parking lot only to find myself at the corner of West Cameron Avenue. I walk towards the Carolina Inn and walk up to the lawn. “What would my mom do on this beautiful spring day?” I ask myself. I smile and decide to sit at one of the outdoor tables and order a glass of white wine (don&#39t worry I&#39m 23). I sit here for about half an hour thinking, reflecting on my mom. How hard it must&#39ve been for her all those twenty-three years ago. How thankful I am to her and to her devotion.</p>
