                    <p>This walk shop revolves around silence, and more than that on the act of listening. The walker is instructed to stop at different locations, close their eyes and listen. This act sounds simple, but it&#39s more complex than that. I began meditating when I was sixteen when I realized that it helped me with my anxiety. Meditation has done wonders for my mental health and has helped me enjoy my surroundings. This walk shop reminded me of when I first started meditating, I felt weird closing my eyes and keeping my mind blank—way easier said than done—and I had a similar experience with this: I closed my eyes and listened to the silence.
                        <br><br>

                        These are my thoughts and notes on that journey.
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to conduct this walk at night, given that I live in a very transited area of Chapel Hill. I started the walk in my apartment, bundled up and headed outside. It was a chilly night, but the silence traveled better in a chilly night.

                    <p>
                        - I hear my neighbors walking past my door in the hallway<br>
                        - I hear the dishwasher cleaning the plates of the dinner I just cooked<br>
                        - I hear the flames of my oak scented candle burning<br>
                        - I decided to stand  rather than lay on my couch since I was beginning to fall asleep.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">THE ELEVATOR</h3>
                    <p>
                        - I hear the elevator do the going down sound after I called it <br>
                        - The doors open and I step into it <br>
                        - Silence <br>
                        - The elevator halts on one of the lower floors, the doors open and in step three girls—pretty sure they were going out and they disrupt my silence<br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">THE STREET</h3>
                    <p>
                        - it was a relatively quiet night especially for chapel hill<br>
                        - I hear in the distance the “trtrtr” of the pedestrian walkways<br>
                        - I hear cars driving past me as I decide to take a left at the light<br>
                        - In the distance I hear a live band <br>
                        - I walk and I think about all the people who are probably sleeping or having a late night snack in the houses nearby <br>
                        - I see people having nearby conversations <br>
                        - I see a delivery driver carrying a pizza, he smiles <br>
                        - I sit on a bench and keep observing, I realize twenty minutes have passed and decide to head home <br>
                    </p> 
                    <h3 class="subtitle">WALK HOME</h3>
                    <p>
                        - I get tired and sleepy, all that silence makes me drowsy<br>
                        - I get to the building, and I feel at ease<br>
                        - There&#39s no one in the hallways anymore and it&#39s deafening quiet <br>
                        - I say hello to the night guard and wish him a good night<br>
                        - I get home and let out a heavy sigh<br><br>
                    
                        This walk, to me, was the most relaxing one yet. I felt like it was an active meditation of sorts: walking, listening, and being aware of my surroundings. Silence can be scary, hearing all of my thoughts at once is overwhelming; yet, it was very therapeutic to do it at night—helped me fall right asleep.
