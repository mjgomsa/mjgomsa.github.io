                    <h4>February 16, 2022</h4>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Pre-walk and Background</h3>
                    <p>This walk-shop revolves around birds— their interactions with us and nature. For centuries, birds have had a deeper meaning to humans: elevation, enlightenment hope and wisdom. For instance the bald eagle signifies freedom in the United Stated, the crow has generally been associated with death, the owl is associated with intellect, etc. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Costa Rica has a myriad of different kind of exotic birds. The Tucan for instance is know for its long, colorful and curvy beak. There are also macaws, which have colored feathers. Yet, aside from these exotic birds we also have more discrete birds, like the national bird el yigüirro— a fist-sized bird with brown feathers.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">The Walk</h3>
                    <p>Being fairly familiar with Costa Rican birds, I realized I knew virtually nothing about birds in the United States. While visiting Davidson, NC at my friend's house, we decided to explore the woods nearby and go on a bird watching excursion. With this in mind, I got ready for my walk and hit play.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We started our walk on the trails and walked about 4 miles. Immediately, I was shocked to see that there were many birdhouses along the trails—was expecting to see a lot of birds on our way. The trees were insanely tall, so I was just hoping the birds would come down to greet us. We walked and walked and walked.</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Recordings</h3>
                    <p> It became a little hard to see the birds, although we could very easily hear their tweets annd echoes of them along the trails. </p>

                    <p>We also walked along different surfaces--crunchy gravel, mushy mud (it rained yesterday), and we saw a little creek</p>

                    <h3 class="subtitle">Descriptions and Naming:</h3>
                    <p>I could hear like five different kinds of birds and decided to name them as such because of how they sounded:
                        <br> 1) Toddle
                        <br> 2) Sing-songy
                        <br> 3) Screetcher
                        <br> 4) Hooter (pretty sure this one was an owl)
                        <br> 5) troody
                    </p>
    
                    <p>The birds seemed like they were having conversations. One would chirp and the other would reply louder. One would sing and the other would kareoke right back. Their language was easily heard but I couldn't really udnerstand what they were saying. How lovely would it be if I could though. As I said before, I wasn't really able to see any of the birds I was hearing (let alone photograph them), this was the only bird that came closer to us to greet him.</p>
