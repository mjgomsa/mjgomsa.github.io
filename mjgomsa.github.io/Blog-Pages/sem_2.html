                    <h5 class="subtitle">Background: Sister Corita Kent. </h5>
                    <p>The intention of this walkshop was to explore walking with a similar process as that of Sister Corita Kent, who was a Catholic nun who lived in Los Angeles in the 60s/70s. The heart of this exercise was to direct our focus to sights that we rarely pay much antention to. By walking around and making use of a small square window, we notice thinngs we wouldn't otherwise.</p>  
                    <br>
                    <h5 class="subtitle">The Pre-walk.</h5>
                    <p>Prior to starting the podcast, I debated where I should walk towards to—what direction, what scenery and what environment I wanted. I did a little "pre-walk" while trying to figure out where I wanted to walk to. I stepped outside my apartment building and took a left, heading towards Franklin St. This was around 2:45pm on a Tuesday, so the road was a little too crowded for my liking—so I decided to head towards campus. I arrived to the corner near Hanes and the Ackland Museum and hit play.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class="subtitle">The Walk.</h5>
                    <p>I started my walk near the Ackland Museum and was determined to walk on campus; yet, I was hesitant of taking the same route I do every day. I arrived to a fork on my road: I could take a right and go the route I always take, or I could go left. I turned left and embarked on my trek. Listening to the podcast I arrived to a bench in front of this building—not sure what the name of it was—and I sat down and began sketching. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At this first site, I noticed the interesting edges of the building, especially where the building's roof began. I grabbed my square window and focused on that sharp 45 degree angle. I sat on that bench for nearly 20 minutes... observing. I was fascinated by the beauty of the building and the nearby trees. I tried the impossible task of following a branch, the trunk to the thinner extremeties onto the twigs. Suddenly, I begann hearing some sort of whistling; at first I thought this might be part of the podcast—but behind the building a man appeared. His lungs filled up with a seemingly never-ending breath—they compressed and decompressed while letting out the most beautiful melody.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>I pulled out my square window and held it up to the building and focused on the details. The first detail that caught my eye was the edge I spoke about above—in my sketch #1. From there, I just inspected the building with my square window and sketched out a few more details that intrigued me. </p>

                    <br><br>
                    <p>The peaceful, quiet and meditative state that the bench gave me, along with the pleasent memory of the "campus whistler's" surprise visit stayed with me for the remainder of my walk—hence, that bench was my place of significance. I then gathered my things and kept on walking...</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I kept walking and came across some beautiful trees that were casting some interesting shadows, I then found a spot on the grass near them and once again got my sketchbook out.</p>

                    <br>    
                     <p>I walked again towards Franklin Street and at this point the traffic was gone for the most part. I decided to sit along one of the many stone walls along the road and sketched some details of the parked car.</p>
                    <img src="/images/img_sem1/IMG_2498.jpeg">
                   
                    <p>That bench will surely become a newly frequented site of mine—I had never walked on campus without a destination in mind, let alone sat on a bench and just observed. It is so interesting to me I've probably walked past that bench dozens of times before and had never thought about taking a seat. I wonder how many other places I haven't really "seen" on this campus, and I cant wait to see them. </p>
